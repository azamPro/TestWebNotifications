Most models treat it as decorative art rather than a structured writing system, resulting in outputs that lack the precision and aesthetic balance of traditional calligraphy.\n\nWe developed Medad, an AI model that transforms plain Arabic text into authentic calligraphic art. Users input text through a web interface, which then is converted to an image and then processed by a Vision Transformer (ViT) model. The model generates a calligraphy-style image while preserving the text’s structure and artistic integrity. A final enhancement step improves the image resolution for better visual quality.\n\nMedad reimagines Arabic calligraphy in the digital age, offering designers, artists, and developers a tool that combines cultural depth with modern AI capabilities.",

        "Full Project Description": "The \"Blind Aid Reading Glasses\" project aims to provide visually impaired individuals with\nan innovative, wearable solution to enhance their independence and interaction with the world.\nThe glasses integrate Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Natural Language Processing\n(NLP), and Text-to-Speech (TTS) technologies into a compact, user-friendly device. Using a\nfine-tuned OCR model, the system captures and processes text from the environment—such as\nsigns, books, or documents—and converts it into spoken words via a customized TTS model.\nThe NLP component improves the accuracy and coherence of the extracted text.\nMotivated by the challenges faced by visually impaired individuals in accessing written\ninformation, especially in Arabic, this project seeks to offer a cost-effective, portable solution.\nExisting assistive technologies are often expensive or lack integration or proper support,\nlimiting their accessibility.\nBy combining fine-tuned models, deployed on a Raspberry Pi 5 and\nintegrated into a 3D-printed glasses frame, the system has the potential to efficiently process\nreal-time scenarios. Once implemented, the system is expected to successfully convert\nenvironmental text into clear audio feedback. This project aims to explore how combining AI-\ndriven technologies with accessible hardware can create powerful assistive devices for the\nvisually impaired.",

        "Full Project Description": "Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is a highly contagious respiratory illness that significantly burdens global public health systems each year. Early and accurate diagnosis of influenza types is essential to reduce the transmission of the virus, alleviate healthcare system pressure, and enhance patient outcomes. In response to these challenges, this project introduces the Flu App, a mobile-based diagnostic support tool designed to detect and classify flu types based on user-reported symptoms. The application combines rule-based classification techniques with machine learning models to provide a scalable and intelligent solution for flu diagnosis in real time.\n\nThe Flu App is developed as an integrated feature within the Sehhaty platform and leverages both artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods. User inputs—such as age, gender, chronic illness, and symptom presence—are analyzed using rule-based algorithms and trained classifiers to predict flu type severity. The project applies well-established classification algorithms, including PART, OneR, JRIP, and J48, implemented via the WEKA platform, to ensure model accuracy and interpretability.\n\nThe system's architecture follows the Waterfall model, comprising the following phases: data collection, requirements analysis, classification model development, implementation, and performance evaluation. The dataset utilized for training includes real-world cases gathered from hospitals across Qassim, Saudi Arabia. To optimize model performance, rigorous preprocessing methods such as handling missing values, discretization, feature selection, and normalization are applied. Evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score are used to assess classifier performance.\n\nExperimental results indicate that the OneR algorithm achieved the highest classification accuracy (91.43%). However, due to its balance between accuracy and rule complexity, the PART algorithm (88.57% accuracy, 4 rules) is selected for final deployment. This decision ensures both high performance and ease of interpretation within a clinical support context.\n\nThe mobile app interface, designed using Figma, offers a user-friendly experience, featuring interactive symptom input forms, personalized diagnostic feedback, and guidance on next steps—whether home care or hospital referral. Users can also contact nearby hospitals directly via the integrated “Help & Support” section.\n\nUltimately, this project contributes a novel, practical, and intelligent digital health tool aimed at facilitating early flu detection and enhancing decision-making for users and healthcare providers. It represents a significant advancement in the application of AI in public health, especially in regions like Saudi Arabia, where flu outbreaks can overwhelm healthcare infrastructure. The project also lays a solid foundation for future enhancements, such as real-time data integration, expanded datasets, and telemedicine support.\n",

The idea is to use a person’s unique voice pattern as a secure method for identity verification. The system records a user’s voice, extracts key features from it, and compares them with stored voice data in the database. This makes login and access control both easier and more secure than using traditional passwords. The voice authentication can be applied to any management system, especially in environments like universities, where secure and fast access is important. Over time, it learns and improves using machine learning techniques. Although voice authentication has been around for years, it’s now gaining more value due to advances in technology. This project aims to combine security and user convenience in a modern, effective way.",

As a solution, this project seeks to address these incidents by developing advanced Deep Learning (DL) models for detecting children left alone in vehicles and estimating their ages. The research utilizes three object detection models, which are YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLOv10, to determine the best performing model, which will then serve as the basis for an age estimation model using EfficientNet-B4. The models are evaluated using two datasets: a private dataset from prior research for object detection, as well as the UTKFace dataset for the age estimation model. Among the object detection models, YOLOv8 achieved the best overall performance with 95.4% precision, making it the chosen model for the subsequent age estimation phase, performed using EfficientNet-B4, which achieved an accuracy of 88%. The developed system demonstrates the potential to enhance child safety by detecting children left alone in vehicles and automatically sending alert messages to parents, contributing to the prevention of pediatric vehicular tragedies.",

It aims to reconnect younger generations with their cultural roots and introduce international audiences to the Kingdom’s traditions in a fun, interactive way.\n\nSet against a vibrant backdrop of Saudi culture, the game blends gamification with storytelling, puzzles, and simulations inspired by real-life customs such as date harvesting, traditional attire, and regional celebrations. Guided by a young Saudi character named Assila, players explore cultural levels that highlight the beauty and diversity of Saudi traditions. Each level is filled with challenges, trivia, and memory-based tasks, offering rewards and fostering learning through play.\n\nCurrently, the game features the “Tammar” level, which introduces players to the world of Saudi dates through three culturally themed mini-games: AlKhraf AlMuzrih and AlSouq. These games focus on the harvesting and trading traditions associated with dates in the Kingdom. Additional levels showcasing other cultural elements are planned for future updates.\n\nBuilt with Unity and designed using tools like Figma, Procreate, and Adobe products, Assila reflects modern game development practices while staying rooted in cultural authenticity. It currently supports offline play, with plans for online features in the future, and includes progression systems, leaderboards, and a user-friendly interface that makes it accessible for players of all ages.\n\nMore than just a game, Assila is a step toward achieving the goals of Saudi Vision 2030, promoting cultural awareness through innovation and technology. With strong support from Qassim University and potential collaborations with national ministries, Assila stands as a pioneering project in the field of cultural gamification in the Kingdom.",

        "Full Project Description": "Project Title:\nAutoRescue – MUJEEB\n\nProject Type:\nGraduation Project – Applied IoT and Smart Emergency Response System\n\nProject Concept:\nAutoRescue – MUJEEB is a smart system designed to automatically detect car accidents and immediately alert emergency services with real-time location data. It uses an Arduino-based device installed in the vehicle, which triggers upon crash detection and communicates with a centralized web-based dashboard. The system aims to reduce response time and improve survival chances in road accidents.\n\nProject Objectives:\nMinimize the time between accident occurrence and emergency response.\n\nAutomatically detect car crashes without manual input.\n\nProvide emergency teams with accurate and real-time location information.\n\nAllow users to notify family members in case of accidents.\n\nIntegrate user identity securely via national platforms like Absher.\n\nTarget Audience:\nDrivers on highways or in remote areas\n\nEmergency services (ambulance, civil defense, police)\n\nGovernment authorities seeking smart safety solutions\n\nSystem Components:\n1. Smart Device Unit (Arduino-Based):\nGPS Module: Captures live coordinates of the crash location.\n\nGSM Module (SIM800L): Sends SMS alerts to the cloud/server.\n\nAccelerometer Sensor (MPU6050): Detects crashes through sudden motion or impact.\n\nArduino Board (UNO/Nano): Core controller handling sensor data.\n\nPower Source: Portable battery or car power adapter.\n\n2. Cloud Backend:\nReceives and stores incident data from the device.\n\nProvides API access to the dashboard and mobile app.\n\nEnsures secure communication and logging.\n\n3. Emergency Web Dashboard:\nDisplays live accident reports with exact location and timestamp.\n\nProvides driver details and accident status.\n\nVisual interface with cards, maps, icons, and status indicators.\n\n4. Mobile App for Drivers:\nSecure login via Absher.\n\nLink and manage the smart device.\n\nEnable/disable family notifications.\n\nView personal accident history.\n\nHow the System Works:\nThe Arduino-based device is installed in the vehicle.\n\nWhen a crash occurs, the accelerometer sensor detects the event.\n\nThe device activates, collects GPS coordinates, and sends data via GSM.\n\nThe cloud receives the data and logs it into the database.\n\nThe dashboard displays the alert to emergency personnel.\n\nOptionally, a notification is sent to the driver’s family via SMS or app alert.\n\nTechnical Details:\nHardware: Arduino, SIM800L GSM module, GPS module, MPU6050 accelerometer\n\nLanguages: C/C++ (Arduino), Python (Django backend), HTML/CSS/JS (Frontend)\n\nDatabase: PostgreSQL or Firebase Realtime DB\n\nAPIs Used: Google Maps API, Absher API (optional integration)\n\nHosting: Cloud platform or local server for dashboard hosting\n\nKey Features:\nAutonomous Detection: No need for driver interaction.\n\nReal-Time Alert: Immediate SMS with coordinates to the dashboard.\n\nCloud Integration: Central system for monitoring all active cases.\n\nGovernment-Ready: Can integrate with official platforms for identity and traffic data.\n\nExpandable Design: Can support more sensors or health status features in the future.\n\nBrand Name:\nMUJEEB (Arabic: مُجيب) – meaning “The Responder”\n\nLogo Style:\nModern and tech-inspired logo reflecting connectivity, urgency, and reliability.\n\n",
